# MG_TextWithImages

TextWithImages for MonoGame.
This class allows for easy texture placement inside text (scaled horizontally to match text line height, while maintaining original image proportions).
Other functionalities are shadow and simple "writing" animation.

You can use this class freely, commercial projects included.
